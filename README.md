# Minikernel.2024 UPM

Simple minikernel implementation that runs on a simulated hardware, the code implemented by me is located in the kernel/ directory.

## Description

In this practice, many of the concepts studied in the discipline of operating systems related to process management, synchronisation, scheduling, device handling and interlock treatment are implemented.
* Operating system start-up.
* Interrupt handling.
* Exception handling.
* Handling of system calls.
* Context switching.
* Process scheduling
* Operating system internal synchronisation
* Inter-process synchronisation
* Input/output handlers
* Handling of interlocks
